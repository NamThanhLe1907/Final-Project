Automated Palletizer System with Image Processing
Project Banner <!-- Replace with your project image -->

📝 Project Description
The Automated Palletizer System with Image Processing is a computer vision-based solution designed to automate the palletizing process. The system uses advanced image processing techniques to detect pallets, calculate their coordinates, and divide them into predefined modules for efficient handling. This ensures precise and automated palletizing operations in industrial environments.

Key Features
Pallet Detection: Accurately detect pallets using image processing algorithms.

Coordinate Calculation: Determine the precise coordinates of the pallet for robotic handling.

Module Division: Divide the pallet into equal modules for systematic processing.

PLC Integration: Communicate with PLC systems to send coordinates and division data.

🛠 Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python

Image Processing Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy

PLC Communication: Snap7

Hardware: Industrial Camera, PLC (e.g., Siemens), Robotic Arm

Development Tools: Visual Studio Code, Git

📦 Installation
System Requirements
Python 3.8+

OpenCV (pip install opencv-python)

Snap7 (pip install python-snap7)

NumPy (pip install numpy)

Installation Steps
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/automated-palletizer.git
cd automated-palletizer
Install the required libraries:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure the PLC and camera settings in the config.py file.

Run the program:

bash
Copy
python main.py
🚀 How It Works
Pallet Detection:

The system captures images from the industrial camera.

Using OpenCV, it detects the pallet and calculates its coordinates.

Module Division:

The pallet is divided into equal modules based on predefined parameters.

The coordinates of each module are calculated for further processing.

PLC Communication:

The system sends the calculated coordinates and division data to the PLC.

The PLC uses this data to control the robotic arm for palletizing.
